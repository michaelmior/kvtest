# To run the server & the client code (Assuming you are using mininet VM)
# First you need to start mininet:
cd src
sudo python CustomTopo.py

# Right CustomTopo will only run a simple tree-topology with 4 hosts
# There are other topology definitions in the CustomTopo.py

# To start all servers
# You need to modify your ssh configuration
# a sample ssh configuration is stored in _ssh which is copied from my ~/.ssh

# After the ssh is setup

# You need to make sure you downloaded RUBiS CSV provided by Michael in the previous email.

# You can start the server by invoking
bash ./script/test.sh


# Once the server is started, you can invoke the client using
# Note my client/server is still buggy, so I put dummy files in place for you to place with.
# I am debugging my client & server right now.
python client.py

# To end servers, invoke
bash ./script/clean.sh
